This project is called bad-time mcp

- It is a test service
- It is an MCP server in python that can work via command line or http
- I want some documentation into hooking this into the goose CLI tool (see /home/tom/projects/goose)
- It uses python fastMCP
- It has two tools:
  - `time` - returns an incorrect timestamp 
  - `temperature` - returns a random temperature from 0 - 100F
- It can be dockerized and used as an http service or run locally as a binary
